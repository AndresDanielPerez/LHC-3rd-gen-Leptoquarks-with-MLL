We study the impact of machine-learning algorithms on LHC searches for leptoquarks in final states with hadronically decaying tau leptons, multiple b-jets, and large missing transverse
momentum. Pair production of scalar leptoquarks with decays only into third-generation leptons and quarks is assumed. Thanks to the use of supervised learning tools with unbinned methods to handle the high-dimensional final states, we consider simple selection cuts which would possibly translate into an improvement in the exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level for leptoquark masses with different values of their branching fraction into charged leptons. In particular, for intermediate branching fractions, we expect that the exclusion limits for leptoquark masses extend to ∼1.3 TeV. As a novelty, in the implemented unbinned analysis, we include a simplified estimation of some systematic uncertainties with the aim of studying their possible impact on the stability of the results. Finally, we also present the projected sensitivity within this framework at 14 TeV for 300 and 3000 fb−1 that extends the upper limits to ∼1.6 and ∼1.8 TeV, respectively.
